=head1 Dada Mail 4 to Dada Mail 5 Upgrade Guide

=head1 Database Schema

There are B<no> changes in any of the database schemas between Dada Mail 4 and Dada Mail 5. 

Upgrading is fairly straightforward, with no need for any Dada Mail 4 to Dada Mail 5 upgrade scripts. 

Users upgrading from Dada Mail v2 or v3 will still need to use the, C<dada3_to_dada4_sql.pl> upgrade script, 
but I<won't> have to first upgrade to Dada Mail v4 and then, v5. 

=head1 Template Changes

There has been considerable changes in the Dada Mail Templates (files that live in, I<dada/DADA/Template/templates>)

The default admin template has been renamed: C<admin_template.tmpl> (from, C<default_admin_template.tmpl>)

Both of these templates have been redesigned.

=head2 Admin Menu Changes

The List Admin Menu has changed in the List Control Panel. If you are upgrading, tell 
the installer to keep the directory structure, but produce a new C<.dada_config> file. You B<will> 
need to reconfigure Dada Mail again, but use the same values for configuration as before. (if you 
forget what they are, view your old C<.dada_config> file and just copy the old values and paste them in the installer)

=head3 Your Subscribers

The B<Your Subscribers> heading has been renamed, B<Membership>

The B<Invite/Add> heading has been renamed, B<Invite/Add/Subscribe>. If you do not have

screen is now called, B<Membership> and has additional features

B<Membership - List Activity> is a new screen.

The B<View> screen has been given a hefty design. We hope it's not as I<Guuuuuugh!> 
as previous, "designs".
