=head1 Upgrading Dada Mail

=head1 Introduction

Before upgrading Dada Mail, find out how you installed and configured Dada Mail before. If you don't know or aren't sure, don't upgrade Dada Mail: you will run into major headaches. 

=head2 "Basic", or, "Contemporary"? (Or Simple Scripts?)

We're going to only differentiate between two types of installations: "Basic" and, "Contemporary" I<(If you installed Dada Mail using the included installer, you have a B<Contemporary> installation)>

=head3 Basic Installation 

A, B<Basic> installation changes the configuration variables right in the, C<dada/DADA/Config.pm> file - usually you want to be very much aware of the following variables: 

=over

=item * $PROGRAM_ROOT_PASSWORD

=item * $FILES

=item * $MAILPROG

=item * $PROGRAM_URL

=back

You'll know if you have a B<Basic> installation of Dada Mail if the
 C<$FILES> variable in the, C<dada/DADA/Config.pm> file is  filled out to a directory that I<actually> exists and that directory holds files/directories that have something to do with Dada Mail. 

If you are running a B<Basic> Installation of Dada Mail, we really suggest upgrading by taking note of where your C<$FILES> variable is located and importing the old information I<after> a clean installation.

=head3 Contemporary Installation 

A Contemporary Installation uses an outside configuration file to set the configuration variables in. 

You'll know if you have a Contemporary Installation, if those same four variables in the, C<dada/DADA/Config.pm> file: 

=over

=item * $PROGRAM_ROOT_PASSWORD

=item * $FILES

=item * $MAILPROG

=item * $PROGRAM_URL

=back

Are still in their default values and your Dada Mail seems to be 
functioning fine. This probably means that your config variables are being read from an outside config file. 

For upgrade purposes, note what the, C<$PROGRAM_CONFIG_FILE_DIR> in the, C<dada/DADA/Config.pm> is set to. It's OK if it's only set to, C<auto>. 

=head3 Simple Scripts Installation

If you installed Dada Mail through Simple Scripts (L<http://simplescripts.com>) you have two good choices when it comes to upgrading. 

=head4 Upgrade Through Simple Scripts

Upgrade a Simple Scripts installed Dada Mail through Simple Scripts on interface (look for an "Upgrade" link, or Simple Scripts may alert you of updates). 

=head4 Turn a Simple Scripts Install into a Contemporary Installation

If you want to use the included Dada Mail installer to upgrade Dada Mail (perhaps, you purchased Pro Dada?), you can turn a Simple Scripts install into a Contemporary Installation with these directions: 

L<http://dadamailproject.com/d/upgrade_from_simple_scripts.pod.html>

=head1 Step #1 Move The Old Program Files Out of the Way

Dada Mail, "The Program" is the collection of files and directories that are in the directory called, C<dada>. 

If you've followed our installation instructions, this directory is most likely located in your I<cgi-bin>. It's directory structure like this: 

 cgi-bin (directory)
    - dada (directory, _lower_ case)
        - mail.cgi 
        - DADA (directory, UPPER case)
            - App (directory)
            - Config.pm
            - etc, etc, etc

This is Dada Mail, B<"The Program">

Simply rename this directory on your hosting account from: 

 dada

to something like:

 dada-old_ver

Moving the directory: 

=over 

=item * Keeps a backup that is known to work 

=item * Makes sure we don't overwrite the old version of the program with the new version

=item * Makes sure we don't mix up the old version of Dada Mail with the new version of Dada Mail 

=back


=head2 Step #2 Install the new Dada Mail

Upgrading will now be similar to installing Dada Mail (L<http://dadamailproject.com/support/documentation/install_dada_mail.pod.html>) 

=head2 Choose, "Upgrade"

The first screen of the installer will ask you if you'd like to Install, or Upgrade Dada Mail. Choose, B<Upgrade>. 

A new form field will appear, labeled, B<Current .dada_files Location>. 

If it can automatically be found, the textbox will be pre-filled with
the absolute path to the parent directory of where the C<.dada_files> directory lives. If this path looks correct, click, B<Continue...>. 

If this isn't the correct location, or no location was pre-filled in, fill in the correct location manually. The installer shouldn't 
allow you to continue, unless this directory is successfully found. 

=head2 Upgrade Options

Two new options are presented to you in the installer, if you are B<upgrading>. 

=over

=item * Create a new .dada_config file

Select this option if you are B<upgrading between major versions> of Dada Mail. For example, version B<4>.0.0 to version B<5>.0.0 or, 
from version 5.B<0>.0 to version 5.B<1>.0. 

Changes are preiodically made to Dada Mail's default configuration and it's a good idea to have the installer create a new C<.dada_config> file to 
take advantage of any new enhancements and also to keep your C<.dada_config> file current and compatible with your new copy of 
Dada Mail. 

The Dada Mail installer does not read your old C<.dada_config> file, so you will have to manually read your old C<.dada_config> file 
and type in the old values. You can view your current C<.dada_config> file clicking the buttom on top of the installer labeled, 

B<View this .dada_config Configuration...>

=item * Use the current .dada_config file

Select this option if you are upgrading between minor versions of Dada Mail. For example, version 5.0.B<0> to 5.0.B<1>. 

The rest of the installer form will be hidden, as no extra configuration is needed. 

=back

=head2 Changelog 

It's a B<I<very very>> good idea to look at the changelog and not B<any> incompatibilities between versions. It's possible that incompatibilities could break your installation, when you upgrade. 

=head1 Screencasts

The following screencast walks through how to upgrade Dada Mail. The original Dada Mail was installed using the Dada Mail installer:
