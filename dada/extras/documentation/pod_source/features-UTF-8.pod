=head1 The Dada Mail and UTF-8 FAQ

=head1 Introduction

Dada Mail can speak UTF-8 and almost expects that everything else around it does, too. 

That means: 

=over

=item * It treats everything it handles as UTF-8

=item * Everything it returns is in UTF-8

=back


=head1 How To Have a Pleasant Experience

It's heavily advised to keep everything in Dada Mail speaking C<UTF-8> without
any real exceptions. 

=head2 Config Variable: $HTML_CHARSET

By default, the config variable, C<$HTML_CHARSET> is set to, C<UTF-8> 

Keep it that way, same case - same everything. 

Dada Mail is only tested with the charset set this way. 

=head2 Advanced Sending Preferences

=head3 Default Character Set 

Set this as, C<UTF-8	UTF-8> 

=head3 Default Plain Text/HTML Message Encoding

There's really only a few choices recommended for Dada Mail. 

=over

=item * 8bit 

Should work. 

=item * quoted-printable

If you have any trouble with C<8bit>, try C<quoted-printable>. Because of the
amount of time that Dada Mail creates, tweaks, formats and templates out email
messages, the encoding can potentially get mucked up. 

This potential mucking-up is mitigated when Dada Mail uses C<quoted-printable> encoding
internally. This should be the default for email messages. 

=back

=head3 Encode Message Headers

Have this option checked. 

=head2 SQL Backends

=head3 Database

=head4 PostgreSQL

Encoding for PostgreSQL databases is done when the database is created - make sure
to create your database with a, C<UTF-8> encoding, like so: 

 CREATE DATABASE dadamail WITH ENCODING 'UTF-8'

=head4 MySQL 

Nothing you'll have to do. 

=head4 SQLite 

Nothing you'll have to do. 

=head4 DBM Files

DBM Files have no encoding support, but Dada Mail knows this and compensates. 

=head3 Schema 

=head4 MySQL 

The MySQL schemas are set to create tables with an encoding of, C<UTF-8> 

=head4 PostgreSQL

Nothing has changed.

=head4 SQLite

Nothing has changed.

=head3 Drivers

The current support SQL backends, C<mysql> (MySQL), C<Pg> (PostgreSQL) and C<SQLite> all have different ways to somewhat, "enable" their UTF-8 support. 

=over

=item * MySQL 

add, 

 mysql_enable_utf8 => 1, 

has been added to the $DBI_PARAMS hashref. 

=item * PostgreSQL

add, 

 pg_enable_utf8 => 1, 

has been added to the $DBI_PARAMS hashref. 

=item * SQLite

add, 

 unicode => 1

has been added to the $DBI_PARAMS hashref. 

=back

No explicit encoding/decoding is done in Dada Mail when saving/retrieving data. Hopefully, the drivers are UTF-8-aware enough.
