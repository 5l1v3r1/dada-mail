=head1 How to Subscribe an Email Address to a Mailing List

A challenge people face is trying to tie Dada Mail's subscription system with another system, like a checkout part of a shopping cart, boards/forum, blog or CMS software.

Dada Mail has hooks into its subscribe system, that you can use by making a small perl script, that can be called from your main program. (If you app is written in Perl, an outside program may not be something you'll need to make) 

=head2 Command Line Utility - subscribe_email.pl

Find a copy of C<subscribe_email.pl> in the Dada Mail distro at: 

C<dada/extras/scripts/subscribe/subscribe_email.pl> 

=head3 Arguments

Run C<subscribe_email.pl> as a shell script, like this: 

 prompt>perl ./subscribe_email.pl --list mylist --email user@example.com 

C<--list> should hold the listshortname of the list you want to subscribe to. 

C<--email> should hold the email address you want to subscribe. 

C<--verbose> is optional. If set to, C<1>, you will get a small report on the request. 

You can also pass Profile Fields for the subscriber, just use the, C<-fields> paramater: 

 prompt>perl ./subscribe_email.pl --list mylist --email user@example.com ---fields first_name=John --fields last_name=Doe

C<subscribe_email.pl> can also be called from within another script using something like Perl's, C<exec> function. 

=head3 PHP Example

Here's an example for a php script, that uses php's C<shell_exec> function (make sure to change the permissions of C<subscribe_email.pl> to, C<755>): 

	<?php
		var $email = 'user@example.com'; 
		var $list  = 'mylist'; 
		shell_exec("/home1/zazarazz/public_html/dadamail/extras/scripts/subscribe/subscribe_email.pl --list $list --email $email");
	?>

To make things easier I<while testing>, you may wish to disable Dada Mail's feature of limiting Subscription Confirmations. This feature disallows someone to 
continually attempt to subscribe the same email address. In testing, this may be exactly what you'd like to do. 

In, I<Your Mailing List - Options> 

Uncheck the option, I<Limit Subscription Confirmation Sending>. Once done testing, you may want to re-enable this option.
