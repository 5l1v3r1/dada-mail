B<(TODO>: 

Create documention on how to do that!

Currently, Dada Mail only comes with one email theme, but should support additional themes in the future, with the idea
that people can create and share their own themes.

Currently, the following layout options are available:

=head4 Mass Mailing Preview

Without needing to send a test message out, you can now preview how your mass mailing will look, right in the Send a Message
screen. This makes it easy to try different layouts and other options out, before comitting to sending to your entire mailing list.

The newly improved HTML email messages also support showing a logo, and list social media likns - these all can be set
