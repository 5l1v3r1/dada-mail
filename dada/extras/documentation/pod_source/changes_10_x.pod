This is mostly a bug-fix release for issues found in v10.0.1 of Dada Mail. 

=head2 Changes

=head3 New Option for HTML Email Messages: Embed of Link Images

By default, all images in an HTML message are attached and embedded within the email message itself. 

This can lead to large email messages, so we've added a new option to simply link to these images instead. 
Look for the option in the List Control Panel under, B<Mass Mailing: Options>. 
This will affect all email messages sent out from a mailing list, 
not just messages sent out in a mass mailing. 

=head3 Content-Disposition header added to embeded image attachments

Related to the abov change, the C<Content-Disposition> header appears to have been missing from the 
MIME part that relates to the attached images. 
This may cause the embedded image to show up by itself at the end of a message, depending on your mail reader. 
We hope the iclusion of this header will stop this from happenig in most mail readers. 

=head3 Bridge, Lock Files, and zombie processes

This is a big one, if you are running discussion mailing lists. 
We've made a few changes, to help make running multiple mailing lists with Bridge a lot smoother. 

The first change we've made is making sure the lockfile created is specifically named for the mailing list being worked on. 
In the past, the SAME lockfile was used for all mailing lists, 
so if there was a problem with one mailing list, 
the next mailing list worked on may not be successful, because the lock was still "live", basically. 
Bridge would also not unlock the lockfile if there was say, a error with logging into the POP3 server, 
causing problems on additional runs of the plugin. 
This may culminate into zombie processes of Dada Mail, as well as perhaps even the POP3 daemon, which may have a connection kept open by a zombie process. 
All of this isn't good stuff, and we hope to have cleared out this problem. 

If you're experiencing zombie processes, and you're running mailing lists with Bridge enabled, these above issues may be affecting you. 
Upgrading could help you out, immensely. 

=head3 Javascript Scrubber Disabled

For the time being, the Javascript scrubber for Dada Mail has been disabled, 
as it also breaks HTML links that have template tags embedded within them.
