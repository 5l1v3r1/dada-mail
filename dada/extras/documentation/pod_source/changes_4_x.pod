=head2 4.0.0 Features

=over

=item * Multiple List Sending

Support has be re-introduced to allow Multiple List Sending. See the separate docs on this feature: 

L<http://dadamailproject.com/support/documentation/feature-multiple_list_sending.pod.html>

=item *  Subscriber Profiles

Please see the docs specifically about Dada Mail Subscriber Profiles:

L<http://dadamailproject.com/support/documentation/feature-profiles.pod.html>

=item *  Subscriber Profile Field Labels

You can now have a, "Label" to your Subscriber Profile Field. A label is what's 
visibly shown and is not now created from the field's name.

=item * Subscription Approval System (Experimental) 

You can now have an, "open to all to subscribe" mailing list, that still requires approval from the list owner. 

Please see the docs specifically about this new feature: 

L<http://dadamailproject.com/support/documentation/features-subscription_approval.pod.html>

=item * Slightly better UTF-8 support. 

This version of Dada Mail is currently shipped with all charsets and encodings to, "UTF-8", but Dada Mail itself is far from support this character set completely. 

This is because it is hard.

Please see the docs specifically about this new feature: 

L<http://dadamailproject.com/support/documentation/features-UTF-8.pod.html>

=item * Twitter Support

Yup. Dada Mail can Tweet. More information: 

L<http://dadamailproject.com/support/documentation/features-twitter_support.pod>

=item * CKeditor Support (Experimental) 

We're experimenting with bringing CKeditor support to Dada Mail. Please see the embedded Config.pm docs about this: 

L<http://dadamailproject.com/support/documentation/Config.pm.html#ckeditor_integration____ckeditor_url__experimental__>

=item * Mass Mailings keep their own log

This means, that anything about the mass mailing is logged for that specific mass mailing - 
this should hopefully make debugging a little bit easier. 

=item * View the Mass Mailing Log from the Mailing Monitor

There's a new link entitled, "Open Mass Mailing Log in a New Window -> "

This functionality is currently extremely rough, but is a pretty easy way to see what, in fact, is going on. 

=item * Slightly Smarter Error Handling for failing sendmail mailings

We've started catching sendmail errors and, if we find an error, we'll exit out of the 
sending process, for the message to be automatically picked up and the last email 
that had a problem, to be tried again. It's currently not perfect, but it's a very small 
step forward.

=item * Clone Settings

You can now clone the settings from one list, to another list, in the, "Create a New List" screen. 

=item * Remove All Subscribers

You can now Remove all subscribers at once in the, I<Manage List - View Subscribers> screen. 

=item * prototype.js/Scriptalicious Support

For the most part, AJAX stuff in Dada Mail has been replaced by the prototype.js 
and Scriptalicious Javascript Libraries. 

=item * Black List Matching

If it wasn't clear or official before, it should be now:

The black list matching does not work with matching strings, but will only work to 
match the user or domain of an email address or the entire email address. These are valid black list entries: 

=over

=item * matchthis@

=item * @matchthis

=item * matchthis 

=item * matchthis@example.com

=back


=item * Plugins Beatitude - Fetch message from URL has same options as, "Send a Webpage" 

Mostly meaning, you can embed images within the email message itself. 

=item * Plugins Mystery Girl

You can now specify the Port Number of the POP3 mail server

=item * Plugins - Dada Bridge

Simple moderation support is included, to Authorized to moderate messages. 

=item * Plugins - Clickthrough Tracker

The Clickthrough Tracker now has a new SQL backend option for the URL redirect list. 

The log is still in PlainText. 

=item * Extensions - Update Subscriptions - REMOVED

The update_subscriptions.cgi extension has been removed, as its features have been superceded by the Dada Profiles
feature. And then some. 

=back

=head1 CPAN Perl Libraries 

The CPAN Perl Libraries needed for Dada Mail are now being saved within the 
Git Repository of Dada Mail. We don't know if this is the greatest idea, since we don't 
really plan on making changes to this modules. But, we're doing it. If any problems 
occur, please report!
