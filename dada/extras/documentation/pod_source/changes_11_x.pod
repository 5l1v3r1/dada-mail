=head1 11.2.7

This is mostly a bug-fix release for issues found in the v11.2.6 release of Dada Mail. A few small changes and features did sneak in: 

=head2 Features

=head3 Show all profile fields in closed (invite only), private mailing list invitation subscription forms

By default, closed/private lists can still invite subscibers, but the subscription form does not show any 
profile fields. This option, found in: B<Membership: Options>, will allow you to show those fields. 

=head3 Number of Profile Fields shown in the admin menu

If you're wondering how many, or even if you have any profile fields, that information is now shown in the 
admin menu itself, saving you a click. 

=head2 Changes

=head3 Log Viewer Plugin: order of logs in popup menu

The following logs will now always be shown first (if the log is available):

=over

=item * Usage Log

=item * Error Log

=item * Bounce Handler Log

=item * Cronjob Output

=back

Then, any other log will be shown - most likely, "Mass Mailing" logs. These logs will stop NOT be in any useful order, but that issue will be addressed in a future release. This is currently an open issue:

=head2 Features

=head3 Set a default version (HTML, Plaintext) for mass mailing authoring

This new feature makes this much easier to configure. In v11.2.1 (and above), go to: 

B<Mass Mailing: Options> 

Under, 

B<Formatting>

set, 

B<Default to authoring:>

to,

B<PlainText Version>

Doing so will: 

=over

=item * select, "PlainText Version" tab by default, instea of "HTML Version""

=item * select, "Write/Paste Text by default" in the PlainText Version tab

=item * select, "Do not send an HTML version (only PlainText version)" in the HTML Version tab

=head1 11.2.0

=head2 Features

=head3 Drafts/Send a Message UI redesign/shuffle

The Send a Message part of the app has been given a healthy UI refresh - some things to look for: 

=head4 Prompt before leaving screen

If you try to leave a draft message screen without saving your changes, 
you'll be reminded of this with a prompt. 
This should help stop you from inadvertently leaving the screen prematurely. 

=head4 Default screen: All Drafts/Stationery/Schedules

When you log into your mailing list's list control panel, 
the default screen is now the  B<All Drafts/Stationery/Schedules> screen, 
rather than the B<Send a Message> screen. 
This is to make loading of the list control panel go a little faster, 
since the Send a Message screen is very complex, 
and takes a while to fully load. 

=head4 Send a Webpage screen removed (but all features moved to Send a Message)

Having two screens that can send a mass mailing seems like one too many, 
so we've removed the B<Send a Webpage> screen. 
Don't worry - all the features on that screen have been added to the B<Send a Message> screen, 
so no features have been removed. 
What has been removed is a lot of duplicate code in the backend. 
Getting rid of this code makes things just that much more simplier to keep well-maintained. 

A mass mailing message can be created by: 

=over

=item * Writing or pasting content into the rich text editor

=item * fetching the message from a specific URL

=item * creating the message from a RSS/Atom feed

=back

from the Send a Message screen

=head4 "All Drafts/Stationery/Schedules" screen changes

Individual Drafts/Stationery/Schedules now how a button to B<Preview> the message, 
without having to open them individually for editing. 

All messages are now sorted by creation date, 
rather than last-modified date, 
and this creation date is shown. 

=head4  Mass Mailing Top Menu Changes

B<Send a Message> has been renamed B<+ New Draft Message>. 
Clicking it will B<always> create a new draft message. 
In previous versions of Dada Mail, 
any previous draft message would get loaded. 
This was problematic, 
if you had more than one draft message 
- things got confusing on just what draft message was now loaded. 
This menu item has moved one item below in the top menu bar of B<Mass Mailing> 

B<Drafts/Stationery/Schedules> has been renamed, B<All Drafts/Stationery/Schedules>
and has been moved to the top of the B<Mass Mailing> top bar menu. 
As has been mentioned, 
this is the defalt screen now when you log into your mailing list's list control panel. 

=head3 New Option: Save Sent Draft Messages as Stationery

Many times, people would like to re-use a previously sent message for a new mass mailing. Now, 
Dada Mail has an option to save previously sent messages you've authored in the list control panel as
new stationery messarges, which you can then use to create a new draft message from. 

=head3 New Ignore Bounces Sublist

Some users have reported problems with addresses they know are valid, 
but which that bounce anyways: 
there's a (hopefully) temporary problem on the receiving mail server. 

To counter this, 
Dada Mail now allows you to set up a list of addresses that the Bounce Handler 
will not process as it does usually. 
Instead, 
bounces from the addresses will just be ignored. 

Addresses can be added simonilar to the Black List and White List: 
segments of addresses are allowed. 

For example,
if you want to ignore a specific email address, 
you can. 
If you want to ignore all address from a domain, 
you can do that as well. 

=head3 RESTful API Support for Update Profile Fields

The RESTful API now supports updating profile fields 
(look for, C<update_profile_fields> in the API docs) 
for an individual email address at a time. 

=head1 11.1.3

=head2 Features

=head3 Markdown Support

Many pieces of plain text copy in Dada Mail are now treated as Markdown markup, and will be treated as such if/when the copy
is used as HTML. 

List Settings that will get this treatment include: 

=over

=item * Mailing List Description

=item * Mailing List Physical Address

=item * Mailing List Privacy Policy

=back

Along with these list settings, mass mailing messages that are authored in plaintext will be treated as Markdown markup if they 
are converted to HTML.

=head3  Mass Mailing Broken - errors about missing, "To" header #744 

L<https://github.com/justingit/dada-mail/issues/744>

This bug, unfortunately, will affect ALL users of at least version 11.0.5 of Dada Mail. If you are using that version, it's 
recommended to upgrade. 

=head3  Bridge: Mass Mailings do not work: "Argument contains empty host portion of address at" error #745

Similar story on this bug.

=head3  "Website URL" and, "Backlink URL" use same list setting key name #731 

L<https://github.com/justingit/dada-mail/issues/731>

Unfortunately, I had to choose one setting to work with one feature, and make the other setting use a different key. 

I've chosen to have the "backlink" URL and Nmae to use different keys. 

=head3  Imported Addresses w/Profile Fields show incorrectly decoded UTF-8 characters #730
