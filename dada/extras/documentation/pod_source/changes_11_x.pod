=head1 11.3.0

=head2 Changes

=head3 Google+ Support Dropped

Google+ has been effectively shuttered, so we've removed support for it from the app. 

=head2 Features

=head3 Enhanced One-Click Unsubscription support via Email Headers (per RFC 8058)

Dada Mail has supported "one-click unsubscribe" when a user clicsk one of the unsubscribe buttons/links in the mailing list message, 
as well as via the C<List-Unsubscribe> email header. The latter of which isn't shown directly to a subscriber, 
but may be used by their mail reader to provide a mechanism to unsubscribe through it's own UI. 

There's a problem though with this C<List-Unsubscribe> header: 

Sometimes the unsubscription link in the header is visted by anti-virus software which, 
after visiting the link will unsubscribe the user without any direct action from the subscriber themselves! 
This leads to all sort of administration problems, as list owners are losing subscribers who would like very much to stay on their mailing list. 

Dada Mail now supports one-click unsubscribe via the C<List-Unsubscribe> header without this problem happening. 
This is done by following RFC 8058, which provides a mechanism to utilize one-click unsubscribe via the headers, but stops the scenario described above from happening. 
 
Any email reader that supports RFC 8058 will allow your subscribers one-click unsubscribe. 
Any mail reader that doesn't support this mechanism will still be able to use the fallback, 
email-only option, also located in the mail header. Either way, incorrect unsubscriptions throught his mechanism shouldn't happen anymore. 
In our testing, we've found that most email readers actually only support emailing the list owner, 
when a user clicks the email reader-provided unsubscribe link. 

=head4 Enhanced List-Unsubscribe header email-only option

If the above mechanism isn't supported by the mail reader, there's a good chance that the fallback is. That fallback being: the mail reader sends an actual email message to the list owner. This email message option has also now been made a bit more useful. In past versions of Dada Mail, an email would be sent to the list owner, telling them the address that wants to be removed as well as the list they should be removed from. 
It was up to the list owner to go through the list control panel to remove this address. 

Starting with v11.3.1, the unsubscription link itself needed to unsubscribe the address from the list 
will be embedded within the email message the list owner receives, 
so all they have to do now is click that link. 

=head4 List-Unsubscribe header can now be enabled/disabled

If one decides instead to not have the C<List-Unsubscribe> header available at all, there is a new option to 
not enable/disable it from being used. 
This option is available in the list control panel under, 

B<Mass Mailing: Options: Headers:> I<Use, "List-Unsubscribe" headers>

=head4 References: 

L<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8058>

=head3 New Options to Complete Unsubscriptions

To coincide with the enhancements to the C<List-Unsubscribe> header, we've expanded the options on what happens when a subscriber clicks the unsubscription buttons/links in mailing list messages themselves.

The three options are now: 

=head4 One-Click Unsubscription

Once a subscriber clicks on a unsubscription link/button in the mailing list message, they'll be unsubscribed right away, with no 
further action by the user. Super convenient for the subscriber! 
And one we suggest, especially since the enhancements to the C<List-Unsubscribe> header
have been made and the problem with anti-virus software getting in the way have now been worked out. 

One issue with this option though is that a user may inadvertantly click the unsubscription button/link, or forward the mailing list message to 
someone else, that then clicks that same button/link. Yikes!

=head4 Click a link/button in Dada Mail

Once a subscriber clicks on a unsubscription link/button in the mailing list message, 
they will be presented with a screen, that just asks them to click a link/button to complete the unsubscription. 
This method may help with people inadvertantly clicking the unsubscribe link/buttons in the mailing list message by mistake. It's the option selected by default. This option is also the newest option added. 

=head3 Fill in the email address, the submit a form

Once a subscriber clicks on a unsubscription link/button in the mailing list message, they will be present with a screen with a form in it, that 
just asks them to fill in their email address to complete the unsubscription. 

This option is a good one, if you're running a discussion mailing list where email messages are commonly replied to/forwarded to other members.
 
The unsubscription buttons/links embedded in the message may be clicked upon by a different user than the one that received the message, and this simple
form can help stop unsubscriptoions done inadvertantly. 

All these options work ndependently to the "one-click unsubscribe" support through the C<List-Unsubsribe> header, which doesn't requires (and cannot have!) any user intervention. 

=head3 Bounce Handler Enhancements

=head4 IMAP Support Added

Set up the Bounce Handler to connect to your Bounce Handler Email address via IMAP. 
This additional option (along with original option of connecting via POP3) gives you more flexibility on how to connect 
to your Bounce Handler Email address to help fit more email hosting scenarios. 
For example, 
those who are using Microsoft Exchange to administrate email may find better success using IMAP,
rather than POP3. 

Option to select B<IMAP> is available in the Dada Mail Installer. 

IMAP support requires that you separately install the C<Net::IMAP::Simple> CPAN Perl module, 
or install/upgrade the C<Bundle::DadaMail> CPAN Perl Module. 

=head3 Instagram Support Added

Add a link to your Instagram profile in your Mailing List Information, the link will be shown in your
mailing list messages, along with Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, and your website links. 

=head1 11.2.9

This is mostly a bug-fix release for issues found in the v11.2.8 release of Dada Mail.

=head1 11.2.7

This is mostly a bug-fix release for issues found in the v11.2.6 release of Dada Mail. A few small changes and features did sneak in: 

=head2 Features

=head3 Show all profile fields in closed (invite only), private mailing list invitation subscription forms

By default, closed/private lists can still invite subscibers, but the subscription form does not show any 
profile fields. This option, found in: B<Membership: Options>, will allow you to show those fields. 

=head3 Number of Profile Fields shown in the admin menu

If you're wondering how many, or even if you have any profile fields, that information is now shown in the 
admin menu itself, saving you a click. 

=head2 Changes

=head3 Log Viewer Plugin: order of logs in popup menu

The following logs will now always be shown first (if the log is available):

=over

=item * Usage Log

=item * Error Log

=item * Bounce Handler Log

=item * Cronjob Output

=back

Then, any other log will be shown - most likely, "Mass Mailing" logs. These logs will stop NOT be in any useful order, but that issue will be addressed in a future release. This is currently an open issue:

B<Mass Mailing: Options> 

Under, 

B<Formatting>

set, 

B<Default to authoring:>

to,

B<PlainText Version>

Doing so will: 

=over

=item * select, "PlainText Version" tab by default, instea of "HTML Version""

=head1 11.2.0

=head2 Features

=head3 Drafts/Send a Message UI redesign/shuffle

The Send a Message part of the app has been given a healthy UI refresh - some things to look for: 

=head4 Prompt before leaving screen

If you try to leave a draft message screen without saving your changes, 
you'll be reminded of this with a prompt. 
This should help stop you from inadvertently leaving the screen prematurely. 

=head4 Default screen: All Drafts/Stationery/Schedules

When you log into your mailing list's list control panel, 
the default screen is now the  B<All Drafts/Stationery/Schedules> screen, 
rather than the B<Send a Message> screen. 
This is to make loading of the list control panel go a little faster, 
since the Send a Message screen is very complex, 
and takes a while to fully load. 

=head4 Send a Webpage screen removed (but all features moved to Send a Message)

Having two screens that can send a mass mailing seems like one too many, 
so we've removed the B<Send a Webpage> screen. 
Don't worry - all the features on that screen have been added to the B<Send a Message> screen, 
so no features have been removed. 
What has been removed is a lot of duplicate code in the backend. 
Getting rid of this code makes things just that much more simplier to keep well-maintained. 

A mass mailing message can be created by: 

=over

=item * Writing or pasting content into the rich text editor

=item * fetching the message from a specific URL

=item * creating the message from a RSS/Atom feed

=back

from the Send a Message screen

=head4 "All Drafts/Stationery/Schedules" screen changes

Individual Drafts/Stationery/Schedules now how a button to B<Preview> the message, 
without having to open them individually for editing. 

All messages are now sorted by creation date, 
rather than last-modified date, 
and this creation date is shown. 

=head4  Mass Mailing Top Menu Changes

B<Send a Message> has been renamed B<+ New Draft Message>. 
Clicking it will B<always> create a new draft message. 
In previous versions of Dada Mail, 
any previous draft message would get loaded. 
This was problematic, 
if you had more than one draft message 
- things got confusing on just what draft message was now loaded. 
This menu item has moved one item below in the top menu bar of B<Mass Mailing> 

B<Drafts/Stationery/Schedules> has been renamed, B<All Drafts/Stationery/Schedules>
and has been moved to the top of the B<Mass Mailing> top bar menu. 
As has been mentioned, 
this is the defalt screen now when you log into your mailing list's list control panel. 

=head3 New Option: Save Sent Draft Messages as Stationery

Many times, people would like to re-use a previously sent message for a new mass mailing. Now, 
Dada Mail has an option to save previously sent messages you've authored in the list control panel as
new stationery messarges, which you can then use to create a new draft message from. 

=head3 New Ignore Bounces Sublist

Some users have reported problems with addresses they know are valid, 
but which that bounce anyways: 
there's a (hopefully) temporary problem on the receiving mail server. 

To counter this, 
Dada Mail now allows you to set up a list of addresses that the Bounce Handler 
will not process as it does usually. 
Instead, 
bounces from the addresses will just be ignored. 

Addresses can be added simonilar to the Black List and White List: 
segments of addresses are allowed. 

For example,
if you want to ignore a specific email address, 
you can. 
If you want to ignore all address from a domain, 
you can do that as well. 

=head3 RESTful API Support for Update Profile Fields

The RESTful API now supports updating profile fields 
(look for, C<update_profile_fields> in the API docs) 
for an individual email address at a time.

=head2 Features

=head3 Markdown Support

Many pieces of plain text copy in Dada Mail are now treated as Markdown markup, and will be treated as such if/when the copy
is used as HTML. 

List Settings that will get this treatment include: 

=over

=item * Mailing List Description

=item * Mailing List Physical Address

=item * Mailing List Privacy Policy

=back

Along with these list settings, mass mailing messages that are authored in plaintext will be treated as Markdown markup if they 
are converted to HTML.
