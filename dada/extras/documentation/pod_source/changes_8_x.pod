=head1 Dada Mail Changelog for v8.x

=head2 8.0.1 

=head2 Summary

This is a bugfix only release of Dada Mail, but touches upon a multitude of problems uncovered after the release of v8.0.0 of Dada Mail.

=head2 Bugfixes

=head3 Bridge

Several problems with encoding have been found in Bridge, most notably when a message in 8bit Content Transfer Encoding and UTF-8 Encoding is sent. Messages are, by default, handled in a different Content Transfer Encoding (quoted-printable), which is basically 7bit. Problem happens if you try to work with these two Content Transfer Encodings together - basically corruption of text. 

To counteract this, messages received by Bridge are first changed to whatever the internal Content Transfer Encoding is, then processed as usual.

=head3 Archives w/Inline File Attachments

Somewhat related to Bridge, archives with inline file attachments wouldn't  show up correctly.

=head3 Multiple Subscribe Extension Script

Subscription confirmation in the C<multiple_subscribe.cgi> extension script would fail, if you have a Profile Field that is required, even if it's submitted with the form.

=head3 Profiles

Profiles had several issues: 

=over

=item * Logging in, after subscription

After a subscription is made, the subscriber should be logged into their profile right afterwards (via a session cookie) and able to visit their profile via the really big button presented to them, without having to know their current login information. This was broken (now fixed). 

Also, when this was broken, it wasn't clear why things didn't work, as no useful error message was presented (fixed as well). 

=item * HTML formatting

Several errors in the HTML was present in the Profile Home screen, leading to some of the interface to be broken.

=item * Logging In

There seemed also to be a problem with merely logging into you Profile in some instances.

=item * Registering an already-existing account

It was also called to our attention that you could still attempt to register an already existing account, even though there's a check in place to hault such an action.

=head3 Send a Webpage

Many problems have cropped up in the Send a Webpage screen, some having to do with problems with encoding (again), and others, when specific types of data are included in the webapge, including linked stylesheets. This would ultimately cause a sending to fail.
