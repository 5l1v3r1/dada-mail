=head1 Dada Mail Profiles Overview

Dada Mail Profiles allow subscribers to a Dada Mail list access to their own profile accounts within Dada Mail, where they can view their current subscriptions, update their subscription information (user-editable subscriber fields) and also have additional permissions to subscriber-only features of Dada Mail mailing lists - as an example; archives that are only available to subscribers of a mailing list. 

=head1 Logging into your Dada Mail Profile

A subscriber can log into their profile, by clicking the, I<[Register/Log In]> 
link that's currently on the top right of the Dada Mail screen: 

=begin html 

<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="http:///dadamailproject.com/images/features/profile_fields/regist_login_link.jpg" /><br /> 
<em>The, [Register/Log In] Link</em> 
</p>

=end html

The Profile Login screen looks like this: 

=begin html 

<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="http:///dadamailproject.com/images/features/profile_fields/profile_login_scrn.jpg" /><br /> 
<em>The Profile Login Screen</em> 
</p>

=end html

There are three separate forms, to log into a profile, register a new profile and to reset a lost password for a profile. Pretty standard stuff. 

Once logged in, your subscriber will find themselves in the Profile Home screen: 


=begin html 

<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="http:///dadamailproject.com/images/features/profile_fields/profile_logged_in.jpg" /><br /> 
<em>The Profile Home Screen</em> 
</p>

=end html 

From here, your subscribers can edit their own subscriber fields, view the lists they're subscribed to and also change their profile password. There's also links to each list's archives and a link to unsubscribe from the list. 

Once logged in, a Dada Mail user can navigate throughout and view their logged in status at the upper right hand side of the screen. 

All the subscription forms in Dada Mail will be auto-filled out with the Dada Mail user's email address and the subscriber fields will be hidden (so as not to have the user have to re-type the same information twice) 



=begin html 

<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="http:///dadamailproject.com/images/features/profile_fields/default_screen_logged_in.jpg" /><br /> 
<em>The Default Dada Mail screen with a logged in user</em> 
</p>

=end html

And that's the new Dada Mail Profiles features, from a user's point of view. 

=head1 List Administration and New Options with Dada Mail Profiles

Since users can now log into Dada Mail, you can now do some fancy things from within your list, concerning list subscribers. 

For example, there are now options to only allow subscribers to view a list's archive: 

=begin html 

<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="http:///dadamailproject.com/images/features/profile_fields/subscriber_only_archives.jpg" /><br /> 
<em>Manage Archives - Archive Options</em> 
</p>

=end html

There's also a new option to skip the closed-loop opt-in system, if a subscriber already has a registered profile: 

=begin html 

<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="http:///dadamailproject.com/images/features/profile_fields/skip_sub_if_reg.jpg" /><br /> 
<em>Manage List - Mailing List Options</em> 
</p>

=end html

This is hopefully, just scratching the surface of what can be done with the new Dada Mail Profile functionality. 

=head1 Other Features to Look Out For

=head2 Subscriber Fields

Subscriber Fields can now have, B<Labels>, so you don't have to use the name of your subscriber field as the label for things like the subscription form. 

Subscriber Fields can now also be easily re-ordered: 


=begin html 

<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="http:///dadamailproject.com/images/features/profile_fields/subscriber_fields.jpg" /><br /> 
<em>Manage Subscribers - Subsriber Fields</em> 
</p>

=end html

=head1 Installing Dada Mail 3.1 with Profile Fields

B<Note! This release is currently an alpha-quality release and is not recommended for production servers!> 

We also do not suggest upgrading any previous Dada Mail to this release, as many of the SQL tables have changed and upgrade tools have not been created yet. 

To install, follow the same installation instructions for Dada Mail 3.x at: 

L<http://dadamailproject.com/installation/>

You will need the SQL backend for Dada Mail to take advantage of the new Dada Mail Profiles feature. 

Profile Specific options are located in the C<Config.pm> file, as well as in the example C<.dada_config> file that comes with this release (I<dada/extras/examples/example_dada_config.txt>)

As always, we suggest making the changes in the C<.dada_config> file. The variables look like in the example .dada_config file: 

	# Dada Mail Profile Options
 
	$PROFILE_ENABLED                         = 1; 
	$PROFILE_EMAIL                           = ''; 
	$PROFILE_ENABLE_CAPTCHA                  = 1;
	$PROFILE_ENABLE_MAGIC_SUBSCRIPTION_FORMS = 1;
 
	$PROFILE_COOKIE_PARAMS = {
		-name   => 'dada_profile',  
	    -path    => '/',
	    -expires => '+7d',	
	};
 
	$PROFILE_GRAVATAR_OPTIONS = {
		enable_gravators     => 1, 
		default_gravatar_url => undef, 
	};
 
	#/ Dada Mail Profile Options

And are explained in the documentation for the Config.pm file. 

Make sure to set the, C<$PROFILE_EMAIL> variable, or profile registration may not work correctly!
