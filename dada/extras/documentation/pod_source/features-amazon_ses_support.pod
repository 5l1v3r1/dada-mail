=head1 Amazon SES Support

=head1 Introduction

From, http://aws.amazon.com/ses/ : 

I<Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) is a highly scalable and 
cost-effective bulk and transactional email-sending service for businesses 
and developers. Amazon SES eliminates the complexity and expense of building an in-house email solution or licensing, installing, and operating a third-party email service. The service integrates with other AWS services, making it easy to send emails from applications being hosted on services such as Amazon EC2. With Amazon SES there  is no long-term commitment, minimum spend or negotiation required - businesses can utilize a free usage tier and after that enjoy low fees for the number of emails sent plus data transfer fees.>

Dada Mail has support for Amazon SES, both by using the Amazon SES API and using the Amazon SES SMTP Interface. The SMTP Interface is probably B<easier to set up>, it's possible that the SES API is B<faster>. 

If you're having trouble sending messages using your hosting account's mail server, perhaps because of the time it takes to complete a mass mailing, or because of the amount of mail you're sending, using Amazon SES may be an interesting alternative. 

Amazon SES costs around $0.10 per thousand messages you send. See: 

L<http://aws.amazon.com/ses/pricing/>

for current pricing. Using the service in a non-production mode is free. 

Dada Mail does not currently work 100% with Amazon's EC2 hosting, which is something else, entirely.  

=head1 Experimental Support! 

Support for Amazon SES is currently labeled as, B<Experimental> (as Amazon labels SES itself as, I<Beta>). We would love your feedback on how it's working for you, but please understand there may be a few unknowns left to uncover. 

Some things to consider: 

=head1 Use for Closed-List Opt-In Subscriptions Lists Only

Since Amazon SES is an outside, third party sending service, you'll absolutely need to use a mailing list that's B<100% confirmed opt-in>. If you don't, complaints of abuse sent to Amazon, manually sent or automatically sent, will most likely disallow you from furthering your use of their service. 

=head2 Bounce Handler Support

Here's the overview of Bounce support for SES:
L<http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/index.html?SendingEmail.BounceAndComplaintNotifications.html>

Dada Mail's support for bounce handling w/SES sending is also B<Experimental>. We'd love to get your feedback. 

When you use Dada Mail with SES, Dada Mail I<will> set the C<Return-Path> header explicitly.

Dada Mail's included Bounce Handler has rules specifically for Amazon SES. 

One caveat of using Bounce Handler is that the Bounce Handler email address has to be verified by Amazon to receive the bounces, just like you would verify a sender. Best thing to do would be to create the bounce handler email address and verify it I<before> you configure the Bounce Handler and the rest of Dada Mail with this address, since Bounce Handler will not automatically verify itself - it'll most likely simply ignore the request. 

=head1 Limitations

=head2 Method: Amazon SES API

=head3 Performance 

Sending via Amazon SES is done with a persistent HTTP connection, so performance shouldn't be too bad. Expect around .3 seconds/message for I<just> passing the email message from Dada Mail to the Amazon SES service. 

=head2 Method: Amazon SES SMTP Interface

=head3 Performance 

It's not known how performance compares to the SES API. 

=head2 Both Methods


=head3 No Discussion List Support

Since every email address that's set in the C<From:> header of any outgoing email message sent through Amazon SES, setting up a discussion list using it is probably unrealistic. 

=head3 Different email headers sent

Amazon has a list of supported email headers: 

L<http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/AppendixHeaders.html>

Dada Mail usually sends messages out with a different set of email headers: 

The, B<Message-ID> header will be sent as the, B<X-Message-ID> header. 

The, B<List> header will be sent as the, B<X-List> header. 

Email headers that are not supported by Amazon SES are automatically not sent out. 

=head3 Sending Quota

Amazon SES starts out with a small sending quota - 10,000 messages you may send in 24 hours, with a maximum 5 messages you can send every second. This quota can grow (and quickly), but make sure not to try to send out quicker than your quota can grow. 

=head4 More Information

L<http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/index.html?ManagingActivity.PlanningAhead.html>

=head1 Dependencies

Amazon SES requires a few more CPAN Perl modules than the base Dada Mail install requires. Make sure you already have, or can install the following CPAN Perl modules: 

=over

=item * Cwd

=item * Digest::SHA

=item * URI::Escape

=item * MIME::Base64	

=item * Crypt::SSLeay	

=item * XML::LibXML

=item * LWP 6

=back

See also the FAQ, B<How do you install, "CPAN Perl Modules"> 

L<http://dadamailproject.com/d/FAQ-general.pod.html#how_do_you_install__cpan_perl_modules>


=head1 Configuration

=head2 Both Methods: Sign up for Amazon Web Services

Begin the signup procedure for Amazon's AWS: 

L<https://aws-portal.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration>

You'll be asked to create a new Amazon account and give Amazon your payment information.

=head2 Method: Amazon SES API

During the installation process, using the included Dada Mail Installer, you'll need to plug in your B<AWS Access Key ID> and a B<AWS Secret Access Key>. Both can found in the B<Security Credentials> section of your AWS account (Under, B<My Account / Console>, click on, B<Security Credentials>). 

The installer will tell you if you meet all the requirements to use Amazon SES, and allow you to test the B<AWS Access Key ID> and B<AWS Secret Access Key> that you plug in. 

=head3 Configuring Dada Mail to use the Amazon SES API

In Dada Mail, log into your list control panel and go to: 

I<Mail Sending - Options> 

There should be an option, along with sending via the sendmail command and sending via SMTP, 
to send via I<Amazon Simple Email Service >. 

If Dada Mail notices you're missing any required CPAN modules, it'll notify you. Don't try using sending via this method, until all these prerequisites are met.

=head3 Verify your List Owner

Before you can send any email messages using Amazon SES in Dada Mail, you have to 
verify your list owner.

Under, I<Amazon SES Tools>, right on the I<Mail Sending  Options> screen, you should see a little verifier. Enter your List Owner email address and click, I<Verify Address for Sending>. You can also use verify addresses in the SES console, itself. 

Once verified, you may use Dada Mail's built-in Mail Sending Options Tester to see if Amazon SES sending is working. 

If it is, congratulations! You're now using Amazon SES to send email out, using Dada Mail. You can further test Amazon SES 
on a small test list by verifying individual addresses in your subscription list using the same verification utility. To 
really use Amazon SES for mass mailing, you'll need to request full production access from Amazon. 

=head2 Method: Amazon SES SMTP Interface

Here's the overview of Amazon SES SMTP Interface: 

L<http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/SMTP.html>

You'll first have to create a SMTP username and password: 

L<http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/SMTP.Credentials.html>

and then configure Dada Mail to use these credentials: 

=head3 Configuring Dada Mail to use the Amazon SES SMTP Interface

Log into your Dada Mail List and go to: B<Mail Sending - Options> 

Choose, B<Send Email Using SMTP>

For the, B<SMTP Server:>, use, C<email-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com>

For the B<Port> use, C<465>

B<Check> I<Use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)>

B<Check> I<Use SMTP Authentication (SASL)>

For B<Type:> use, B<PLAIN>

Fill out the, B<Username> and B<Password> with the username and password provided by Amazon. 

=head3 Verify your List Owner

B<Sign in to the AWS Management Console> at, 

L<https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home>

Once at the Amazon AWS Console, click the, B<Amazon SES> tab, click on, B<Verified Senders> and click the button labeled, B<Verify a New Sender>. Enter in your List Owner. You will have to do this for each different List Owner you plan to use. 

=head2 Set Your Mass Mailing Batch Settings

You'll want to make sure to send below your Amazon SES sending quota. This can be done automatically by Dada Mail. 

Go to: B<Mail Sending - Mass Mailing Options> and check the option, 

B<Automatically set batching speeds based on your Amazon SES limits>

Your batch settings will now grow or shrink, depending on your current Amazon SES sending limits. If you do go over your total 24 hour quota, mass mailings will not be sent out, and batches will be set to wait for 5 minutes, before trying to be sent again. When your 24 hour quota is lifted, sending will once again take place. 

=head2 Both Methods: Request Full Production Access

Once you're done testing Amazon SES, you'll want to request full production access: 

L<http://aws.amazon.com/ses/fullaccessrequest>

Without full production access, you'll only be able to send messages to addresses that have manually been verified. 

=head1 Alternative Ways to Use Amazon SES with Dada Mail

You can use Amazon SES through your existing mail server, as outlined here: 

L<http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/IntegratingWithServer.html>


=head1 SPF, Sender ID, and DKIM

Since you're asking a third party to send email on behalf of you, you'll most likely want to make sure you have  a correct B<SPF Record> set up to tell the world that that's OK. 

Amazon's doc's have an overview on how to do this, 

L<http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/index.html?SPFSenderIDDKIM.html>
