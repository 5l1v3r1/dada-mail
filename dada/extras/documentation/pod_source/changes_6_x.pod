=head1 6.3.0

=head2 Summary 6.3.0 

v6.3.0 of Dada Mail comes with enhancements to Dada Mail's Amazon SES sending support, Gravatar support and support for tracking email addresses on message opens/clickthroughs. 

=head2 Features 6.3.0

=head3 Amazon SES setup: Vastly Simplified

Dada Mail's included installer now supports setting up Amazon SES for you - all you'll need to do is give it your B<AWS Access Key ID> and B<AWS Secret Access Key>.

You no longer need to set up a seperate C<aws-credentials> file, or download, configure and install any outside Amazon SES scripts. 

The installer will check to make sure all required CPAN modules are installed, and also has a small tester utility to make sure Amazon SES is working. 

The installer will also be able to detect your previous Amazon SES settings, when you decide to upgrade. 

More information on Dada Mail and Amazon SES:

=head3 Email Tracking for Opens/Clickthroughs

Dada Mail can now be set to optionally track email addresses, when tracking Clickthroughs and Message Opens. These address can currently be exported per mass mailing. This feature is somewhat experimental, as features that can stem from this new ability will be vastly expanded on in the future. We'd like to get the feature out there, in it's current state, to start gathering information to be used for analytic support. 

This feature also requires changes to Dada Mail's SQL schema, which should happen automatically during the first run of Dada Mail, right after an upgrade. One can perform these changes manually, by issuing the following SQL: 

	ALTER TABLE dada_clickthrough_url_log ADD email VARCHAR(80);
	ALTER TABLE dada_mass_mailing_event_log ADD email VARCHAR(80);

The option to track email addresses is located in the Tracker's list control panel screen, under, B<Preferences> - B<Track with Email Addresses>. 

=head3 Admin Menu: Archive Count now shown

The list control panel's admin menu will now list how many archives you have, under, B<Message Archives - View (# of messages)>

=head3 Extended Gravatar Support

Gravatars ( https://en.gravatar.com/ ) now show up in the List screen, the List's Archive indexes, and in the B<blog_index.cgi> plugin. 

=head3 Password Protect Directories Plugin: Works with already-exisiting .htaccess

In past versions, the Password Protect Directories Plugin would write (and if there was an already existing .htaccess file, Write I<Over>) its own C<.htaccess> file. This does not play nicely with anything else that may need to use an .htaccess file. 

Now, this plugin will first look and see if an C<.htaccess> file exists, and if so, if specific directives for the plugin itself exist. If so, the plugin will only update the file and change the directives it needs in order for the plugin to work. 

It's advised, that if you upgrade to first disable the plugin's cronjob, remove the directives in the C<.htaccess> file specific for the plugin (or the entire C<.htaccess> file, if nothing else requires this file, upgrade, and then re-set the cronjob for this plugin. 

=head3 Geo IP databases Updated

Dada Mail has updated it's Geo IP databases to the newest, April 2013 release. 

I<This product includes GeoLite data created by MaxMind, available from L<http://www.maxmind.com>.>

=head3 blog_index.cgi extension: cached screens

The HTML/Javascript data that the C<blog_index.cgi> extension makes are now cached, helping relieve unneeded load on your backend. 

=head1 6.2.2

=head2 Summary 6.2.2

This release fixes bugs found in the v6.2.1 version of Dada Mail. It's a suggested upgrade for anyone running v6.2.1 or lower. 

=head2 Changes 6.2.2

=head3 Bounce Handler - new rules

More rules were added to the Bounce Handler, to better parse bounces

=head3 Redirect URLs in Sub/Unsub process detect query strings

These URLs also can add their own query strings, to pass information, but if you set a URL that already has a query string, 
things will break. This issue is now fixed. 

=head2 Bugfixes 6.2.2

=head3  Bug with multiple subscribe  

L<https://github.com/justingit/dada-mail/issues/365>

=head3 Unsubscription Confirmations, puts an extra "?" to the url

L<https://github.com/justingit/dada-mail/issues/364>

=head3 convert_to_ascii in DADA::App::Guts strips out characters like, Ü, ß, etc

L<https://github.com/justingit/dada-mail/issues/361>

=head2 Summary 6.2.1

There was a mis-labeling of v6.2.0 as v6.1.2, which never had a release. v6.2.1 is released simply to fix this bobble. 

=head1 6.2.0

=head2 Summary 6.2.0

This release follows up on the discovery that a lot of the weirdness with the sub/unsub confirmation process 
happens when the sub/unsub request, and the sub/unsub confirmations come from different IP Addresses. 

To counter that in a simple way, there's now a check for IP address same-ness, and if that test fails, 
a simple screen is shown, presenting the user to manually click on the button to finish the confirmation process.
This screen isn't meant to actually be shown to the user, other than in somewhat strange circumstances. 

We've written an extended description about this here: 

L<http://dadamailproject.com/cgi-bin/dada/mail.cgi/archive/homepage_blog/20130310231707/>

=head2 Bugfixes 6.2.0

=head3 Subscriber profile fields disappeared.

L<https://github.com/justingit/dada-mail/issues/358>

=head3 "Unknown code ref type given ''. " in "Advanced Archive Options" screen

L<https://github.com/justingit/dada-mail/issues/357>

=head1 6.1.1

=head2 Summary 6.1.1

This release fixes bugs found in the v6.1.0 version of Dada Mail.

=head2 Changes 6.1.1

Working with the new confirmation link token system, we've noticed that strange things seem to happen, 
when the IP address used to initiate, say, a subscription, or unsubscription is different from the IP address
used to confirm that same sub/unsub. This may point to an automated process following these links, instead of 
an actual human. For now, these types of events will be logged in the error log, but may be more actively handled
in future versions of Dada Mail. 

=head2 Bugfixes 6.1.1

=head3 Hidden Fields are shown in the Subscription Form

L<https://github.com/justingit/dada-mail/issues/354>

=head3 "Save, Then Test" in Mail Sending >> Options changes preferences

L<https://github.com/justingit/dada-mail/issues/353>

=head3 Bug in DADA::App::BounceHandler::Rules prevents Bounce Handler from properly parsing bounces

https://github.com/justingit/dada-mail/issues/355

=head3 Default CAPTCHA will fail, even if it says it won't

L<https://github.com/justingit/dada-mail/issues/356>

=head2 Summary 6.1.0

This release of Dada Mail features a new URL confirmation system that is hoped to be more secure 
and less easy to spoof than previous iterations of Dada Mail. Since the previous system has been used 
in one form, or anothr, in Dada Mail since the original release of the app in 1999, we highly suggest literally I<anyone>
running Dada Mail to upgrade.

An extended reasoning and explaination for the changes made in this version can be found at: 

L<http://dadamailproject.com/cgi-bin/dada/mail.cgi/archive/homepage_blog/20130218232934/>

As always, we look forward to your feedback about the changes and enhancements we make in Dada Mail.

=head1 6.0.1

=head2 Summary 6.0.1

This release features one minor bug fix to the Bridge plugin, no other code changes are present. If you are using the v6.0.0 B<Stable> release, 
but are not using the Bridge plugin, this upgrade is entirely optional. 

If you're already running v6.0.0 Stable of Dada Mail, and would like to simply replace the I<dada/plugins/bridge.cgi> 
script, with the fixed version, you may do so: 

L<https://github.com/justingit/dada-mail/blob/8547605c588d6ed5ee59d08698863e6986b8d3f4/dada/plugins/bridge.cgi>

=head1 6.0.0

=head2 Summary 6.0.0

This major release of Dada Mail includes major changes to the Dada Mail codebase. A detailed explanation of these changes, compared to v5 of Dada Mail can be found at, 

L<http://dadamailproject.com/d/dada5_to_dada6.pod.html>

When upgrading from I<any> previous version of Dada Mail, make sure to create a new C<.dada_config> file, as old C<.dada_config> files will not work with v6 of Dada Mail. 

=head1 6.0.0 Release Candiate 2

=head2 Summary 6.0.0 Release Candidate 2

The changes below summarize the differences between RC1 and RC2 of the v6.0.0 Release

=over

=item * Membership >> Invite/Subscribe/Add was not functional, for anything except for the Subscribers sublist

This was a problem of a missing class in the, B<Add Checked Addresses to [sublist]> button. 

=item * Mass Mailing Started/Finished log messages were truncated

These log messages were missing some of the information that should have been present. 

=item * "Mass Mailing Finished" Message had the incorrect "finishing time" and, "Duration Time"

=item * Plugin URLs and Installer URL better guessed

The installer and plugin URLs attempt to guess their own URL, so you do not need to configure these things, yourself. 

Unfortunetly, it does not always get them right, depending on your hosting environment. Code has been added to make this guess better. 

=item * Screen Cache plugin's HTML has now been templated out

=item * Beatitude: Some options could not be saved, due to sloppy HTML

=item * CKEditor and the, "{C}" string: 

CKeditor seems to place the, "{C}" string in the source of HTML messages, when there'a a comment tag in an, "href" tag attribute (like, for example, in a link). Since Dada Mail's template tags are also valid HTML comments, they are found in, "href" attributes often. 

This string is never I<removed> by CKeditor, and thus, will break the link. It seems that this character is some sort of placeholder for comment tags, but seems not to be handled correctly by CKeditor. 

This string is now looked for, and removed, before messages are sent. 

=item * "Automatically set batching speeds based on your Amazon SES limits" was not functioning correctly 

=item * The Default CAPTCHA type was not working correctly, always returning an error

=item * Better support for server environments that don't support data sent via Path Infos

There's a trick in Dada Mail, where you can set the Program's URL to have a, "?" at the end of the URL, like this: 

	$PROGRAM_URL = 'http://example.com/cgi-bin/dada/mail.cgi?'; 

Which will then turn any Path Info, into a query string

Dada Mail will now correctly look for this, and use any information that I<looks> like a Path Info, passed as a query string as Path Info information and also correctly read double-question mark query strings correctly as well. 

It's still a hack-y workaround, but hopefully, could help someone get their work done. Is this a problem with "Zeus" webservers?

=item * Installer: now correctly removes the old screen cache, during an install/upgrade

=item * Installer: now correctly set the, $PROGRAM_ERROR_LOG variable, even if the .dada_files location is set to, "auto"

=item * Bounce Handler: web-based interface to parse bounces broken

The web-based interface to check any awaiting messages and parse them would look as if you're testing messages, but the messages would actually be parsed, scored and logged, except the messages would not be removed. This has been fixed.
