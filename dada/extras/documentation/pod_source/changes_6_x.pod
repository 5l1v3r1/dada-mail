=head2 Features 6.5.0 alpha 3

=head3 New Plugin: Global Config

B<Global Config> is a new plugin for Dada Mail. It allows you to easily drop back into Dada Mail's included Installer, letting you reconfigure Dada Mail's global configuration. 

This plugin itself is itself can be installed via the Dada Mail Installer. 

=head3 Enhanced Installer: More Configuration Options

This version of Dada Mail features many additional configuration options available when using the included Installer:

=head3 Client-Side Form Validation

Dada Mail now includes the B<jQuery Validation Plugin>, and uses this plugin for client-side form validation in the Dada Mail Installer, Subscription form, Create a New List form, and the various Dada Mail Profile forms. I<(Server-side validation is still there)>

=head3 Mailing List Switcher Form Enhanced

Dada Mail now includes the B<Select2 jQuery Plugin>, and utilizes it in the Mailing List Switch Form you'll see in the upper right hand corner of the List Control Panel. With this plugin, it's now easier to find the mailing list you'd like to work with, especially if you have many dozens of mailing lists running on your Dada Mail. The enhancement allows you to search through the available mailing lists, rather than just simply scrolling through them. 

=head2 Changes 6.5.0 alpha 3

=head3 Installer-specific JavaScript: Removed from main, "dada_mail.js" File

Installer-specific JavaScript has been removed from the main, "dada_mail.js" file, creating a smaller "dada_mail.js" file. 


=head3 new, "dada_mail.user.js" file

The, "dada_mail.user.js" file holds JavaScript for user-facing Dada Mail screens. At the moment, this is most client-side form validation for various user forms, including the Subscription Form. 

The following new HTML can be seen in the head of the C<list_template.tmpl>

	<script src="<!-- tmpl_var SUPPORT_FILES_URL -->/static/javascripts/jquery-1.8.2.min.js"></script>
	<script src="<!-- tmpl_var SUPPORT_FILES_URL -->/static/javascripts/jquery.validate.js"></script>
	<script src="<!-- tmpl_var SUPPORT_FILES_URL -->/static/javascripts/dada_mail.user.js"></script>

You may optionally add these lines to your own List Template to gain the same client-side valiation, but this is currently entirely optional. 

Documentation on these lines will be made available, once the stable release of v6.5.0 is made. 

=head1 6.4.3

=head2 Summary 6.4.3

This version is primarilly a bug-fix release.

=head3 Bridge: Moderation Links Broken

L<https://github.com/justingit/dada-mail/issues/381>

=head1 6.4.1

=head2 Summary 6.4.1

This version is primarily a bug-fix release, dealing with mass mailings that will be paused as soon as they're created.

It's a problem that probably started in the v6.4.0 release of Dada Mail (although it could have bitten those before this ver.). 

The fix was made basically in one file, so if you are currently running B<v6.4.0> of Dada Mail (and ONLY this version), you may do the following, instead of having to completely re-install Dada Mail: 

The file that needs to be changed out is at: I<dada/DADA/Mail/MailOut.pm> 

Rename the current, I<MailOut.pm> file you have within your Dada Mail installation. 

Grab the version of the MailOut.pm file w/the bugfix, here: 

L<https://raw.github.com/justingit/dada-mail/v6_4_1-stable_2013_06_09/dada/DADA/Mail/MailOut.pm>

And put this version up, where the original file was, in: I<dada/DADA/Mail>  

Good to go! Again, these directions are only for users who are currently running B<v6.4.0> of Dada Mail. Everyone else is suggested to upgrade Dada Mail using the usual upgrade directions. 

This bugfix may also help the problem with Mass Mailings that I<finish> correctly, but also leave a notice in the Mailing Monitor, that it's still around and corrupted. We'd love to hear your feedback. 

=head2 Bugfixes 6.4.1

=head3 Mass Mailings Sometimes Paused After Creation 

L<https://github.com/justingit/dada-mail/issues/379>

=head1 6.4.0

=head2 Summary 6.4.0

=head2 Features 6.4.0

=head3 Unsubscription Process: Vastly Simplified

The unsubscription process for Dada Mail has been redesigned, and is now much more simplified than it has been in past versions of Dada Mail. Here's how it works: 

All mass mailings require an unsubscription link to be present in the message itself. This unsubscription link is now unique to the mailing list, mass mailing and subscriber it's sent to. 

Clicking an unsubscription link will bring the subscriber to a screen with a simple form which only requires that they fill out their email address. An optional email address hint can be shown, to help your subscriber know which email address they're subscribed with. Once a subscriber has filled out their email address and submitted the form, they will be unsubscribed immediately. There is no longer an option to send an unsubscription confirmation email message to the user. 

The unsubscription link will be removed in discussion lists when messages are replied to, to stop potentially re-sending the unique unsubscription link of a subscriber, to the entire mailing list. Unsubscription links will also be removed from archive messages. 

To make the unsubscription process as simple and fool-proof as possible, many of the advanced options that were available in the mailing list's control panel have been removed. This was done to make 100% sure that users of Dada Mail were following email best practices, as well as following the newest CAN SPAM 2008 revision. 

Unsubscriptions are now tracked, and data can be viewed/exported in the Tracker plugin. The date of the unsubscription, IP address, subscriber email address, mass mailing the unsubscription was made from, as well as the mailing list the unsubscription was for, will be logged.

More information about Dada Mail's Unsubscription System can be found in the new feature overview for unsubscriptions: 

L<http://dadamailproject.com/d/features-unsubscription_system.pod.html>

=head3 Tracker Plugin

=head4 Tracker Preferences: Simplified

Tracker preferences have been simplified, to make sure as much data is collected by default, and the Tracker's powerful features are as easy to use, as possible. You may now track clickthroughs automatically, or manually; track message opens directly or indirectly, and track with or without subscriber's email address. Tracking, Archive Views, "Forward to a Friend" and Bounces will always be enabled for you. 

=head4 Faster!

Work has been done to make the index of mass mailings data and graph render faster. Expect speedups of 2x-5x. 

=head4 Opens: Total + Unique Reported

Message Opens are now reported as both the total amount of opens recorded per message, as well as unique opens per message/subscriber. The percentage of unique opens/total subscribers is also shown. 

=head4 Subscriber Activity

Message data is now reported by subscriber, as well as by IP/location/Over Time. Activities such as Message Opens, Clickthroughs, Unsubscribes and Bounces are shown per-subscriber in chronological order. Subscribers are sorted from most active to least active, allowing you to easily see who your busiest members are, and what they're doing. 

=head4 Unsubscribes 

Subscriber Unsubscribes are now logged in Dada Mail and reported by the Tracker plugin. a seperate tab in the message Tracker shows a list of all unsubscriptions; data is also broken down by domain name, and graphed over time. 

=head4 Total Recipients Logged

Dada Mail has the ability to send a mass mailing to only part of a mailing list, but up until now, only logged the total subscriber count. Now, Dada Mail will log both the total subscriber count, plus the total count of recipients that are sent the message. This will help Tracker message reports to be more precise.  

=head4 csv Export Email Lists: Soft/Hard Bounces, Unsubscribes, Email Activity

Tracker supports csv exporting email addresses for soft/hard bounces, unsubscribers, and email activity, for each message. 

=head3 Partial Sending Options Expanded

Partial List Sending has now been expanded to allow you to search both with what could be in your list (equal, like), as well as what may not be in your list (not equal to, unlike). 

You may now search for more than one term, per field, at one time - example: a First Name of either I<Justin>, OR I<John>. This is done by simply listing the various search terms you'd like, separated by a comma. For example, First Name is Like B<Justin,John>

=head2 Bugfixes 6.4.0

=head3 Non-ASCII header fields of sent message are not MIME-encoded

L<https://github.com/justingit/dada-mail/issues/322>

=head1 6.3.1

=head2 Summary 6.3.1

This release fixes bugs found in the v6.3.0 version of Dada Mail. It's a suggested upgrade for anyone running v6.3.0 or lower.


=head3 SQL Table schema checker looks for wrong # of needed tables (off by one, problem)

L<https://github.com/justingit/dada-mail/issues/369>

=head3 Password Protect Directories: "AuthName" in .htaccess file left unquoted

L<https://github.com/justingit/dada-mail/issues/368>

=head1 6.3.0

=head2 Summary 6.3.0 

v6.3.0 of Dada Mail comes with enhancements to Dada Mail's Amazon SES sending support, Gravatar support, block css to inline css conversion for HTML messages (experimental), and support for tracking email addresses on message opens/clickthroughs. 

=head2 Features 6.3.0

=head3 Amazon SES setup: Vastly Simplified

Dada Mail's included installer now supports setting up Amazon SES for you - all you'll need to do is give it your B<AWS Access Key ID> and B<AWS Secret Access Key>.

You no longer need to set up a seperate C<aws-credentials> file, or download, configure and install any outside Amazon SES scripts.

The installer will check to make sure all required CPAN modules are installed, and also has a small tester utility to make sure Amazon SES is working. Be warned that Amazon SES sending does have a long list of prerequisites, some of which may need to be seperately installed via CPAN. 

The installer will also be able to detect your previous Amazon SES settings, when you decide to upgrade.

More information on Dada Mail and Amazon SES: 

L<http://dadamailproject.com/d/features-amazon_ses_support.pod.html>

=head3 Email Tracking for Opens/Clickthroughs

Dada Mail can now be set to optionally track email addresses, when tracking Clickthroughs and Message Opens. These address can currently be exported per mass mailing. This feature is somewhat experimental, as features that can stem from this new ability will be vastly expanded on in the future. We'd like to get the feature out there, in it's current state, to start gathering information to be used for analytic support and gain feedback on this new feature. 

This feature also requires changes to Dada Mail's SQL schema, which should happen automatically during the first run of Dada Mail, right after an upgrade. One can perform these changes manually, by issuing the following SQL: 

	ALTER TABLE dada_clickthrough_url_log ADD email VARCHAR(80);
	ALTER TABLE dada_mass_mailing_event_log ADD email VARCHAR(80);

The option to track email addresses is located in the Tracker's list control panel screen, under, B<Preferences> - B<Track with Email Addresses>. 

=head3 Mass Mailings:  Convert CSS <style> blocks to inline styles in HTML messages

Support has been added to Dada Mail to allow you to author HTML messages with your CSS stylings in the head of your document (easy to author), but have the CSS converted to inline styles (more universally supported in mail readers). 

This option can be found in the list control panel under, B<Mass Mailing - Options>: I<Convert CSS style blocks to inline styles in HTML messages (Experimental)> 

This is an experimental feature, and you will have to seperately install the C<CSS::Inliner> Perl CPAN module. 

Installer CPAN modules is covered here: 

L<http://dadamailproject.com/d/FAQ-general.pod.html#how_do_you_install__cpan_perl_modules>

=head3 Admin Menu: Archive Count now shown

The list control panel's admin menu will now list how many archives you have, under, B<Message Archives - View (# of messages)>

=head3 Extended Gravatar Support

Gravatars ( https://en.gravatar.com/ ) now show up in the List screen, the List's Archive indexes, and in the B<blog_index.cgi> plugin. 

=head3 Password Protect Directories Plugin: Works with already-exisiting .htaccess

In past versions, the Password Protect Directories Plugin would write (and if there was an already existing .htaccess file, Write I<Over>) its own C<.htaccess> file. This does not play nicely with anything else that may need to use an .htaccess file. 

Now, this plugin will first look and see if an C<.htaccess> file exists, and if so, if specific directives for the plugin itself exist. If so, the plugin will only update the file and change the directives it needs in order for the plugin to work. 

It's advised, that if you upgrade to first disable the plugin's cronjob, remove the directives in the C<.htaccess> file specific for the plugin (or the entire C<.htaccess> file, if nothing else requires this file, upgrade, and then re-set the cronjob for this plugin. 

=head3 Geo IP databases Updated

Dada Mail has updated it's Geo IP databases to the newest, April 2013 release. 

I<This product includes GeoLite data created by MaxMind, available from L<http://www.maxmind.com>.>

=head3 blog_index.cgi extension: cached screens

The HTML/Javascript data that the C<blog_index.cgi> extension makes are now cached, helping relieve unneeded load on your backend. 

=head3 Support in Detecting Outside CPAN Perl Libraries

To help make using the more advanced features of Dada Mail - ones that require you to install additional Perl CPAN modules that aren't included with Dada Mail (Amazon SES, Gravatars, JSON, etc), Dada Mail itself will attempt to detect common places where private, account-specific Perl libraries are placed. By default, Dada Mail will look for Perl Libraries in the home directory of an account. 

If you are running a Cpanel-powered account, Dada Mail will play well with how Cpanel's B<Perl Module Installer> work.

=head2 Changes 6.2.2

=head3 Bounce Handler - new rules

More rules were added to the Bounce Handler, to better parse bounces

=head3 Redirect URLs in Sub/Unsub process detect query strings

These URLs also can add their own query strings, to pass information, but if you set a URL that already has a query string, 
things will break. This issue is now fixed.

=head3 convert_to_ascii in DADA::App::Guts strips out characters like, Ü, ß, etc

L<https://github.com/justingit/dada-mail/issues/361>

=head2 Summary 6.2.1

There was a mis-labeling of v6.2.0 as v6.1.2, which never had a release. v6.2.1 is released simply to fix this bobble. 

=head1 6.2.0

=head2 Summary 6.2.0

This release follows up on the discovery that a lot of the weirdness with the sub/unsub confirmation process 
happens when the sub/unsub request, and the sub/unsub confirmations come from different IP Addresses. 

To counter that in a simple way, there's now a check for IP address same-ness, and if that test fails, 
a simple screen is shown, presenting the user to manually click on the button to finish the confirmation process.
This screen isn't meant to actually be shown to the user, other than in somewhat strange circumstances. 

We've written an extended description about this here: 

L<http://dadamailproject.com/cgi-bin/dada/mail.cgi/archive/homepage_blog/20130310231707/>

=head2 Bugfixes 6.2.0

=head3 Subscriber profile fields disappeared.

=head3 "Unknown code ref type given ''. " in "Advanced Archive Options" screen

=head1 6.1.1

=head2 Summary 6.1.1

This release fixes bugs found in the v6.1.0 version of Dada Mail.

=head2 Changes 6.1.1

Working with the new confirmation link token system, we've noticed that strange things seem to happen, 
when the IP address used to initiate, say, a subscription, or unsubscription is different from the IP address
used to confirm that same sub/unsub. This may point to an automated process following these links, instead of 
an actual human. For now, these types of events will be logged in the error log, but may be more actively handled
in future versions of Dada Mail. 

=head2 Bugfixes 6.1.1

=head3 Hidden Fields are shown in the Subscription Form

L<https://github.com/justingit/dada-mail/issues/354>

=head3 "Save, Then Test" in Mail Sending >> Options changes preferences

=head3 Bug in DADA::App::BounceHandler::Rules prevents Bounce Handler from properly parsing bounces

https://github.com/justingit/dada-mail/issues/355

=head3 Default CAPTCHA will fail, even if it says it won't

L<https://github.com/justingit/dada-mail/issues/356>

=head2 Summary 6.1.0

This release of Dada Mail features a new URL confirmation system that is hoped to be more secure 
and less easy to spoof than previous iterations of Dada Mail. Since the previous system has been used 
in one form, or anothr, in Dada Mail since the original release of the app in 1999, we highly suggest literally I<anyone>
running Dada Mail to upgrade.

An extended reasoning and explaination for the changes made in this version can be found at: 

L<http://dadamailproject.com/cgi-bin/dada/mail.cgi/archive/homepage_blog/20130218232934/>

As always, we look forward to your feedback about the changes and enhancements we make in Dada Mail.

=head2 Summary 6.0.1

This release features one minor bug fix to the Bridge plugin, no other code changes are present. If you are using the v6.0.0 B<Stable> release, 
but are not using the Bridge plugin, this upgrade is entirely optional. 

If you're already running v6.0.0 Stable of Dada Mail, and would like to simply replace the I<dada/plugins/bridge.cgi> 
script, with the fixed version, you may do so:

When upgrading from I<any> previous version of Dada Mail, make sure to create a new C<.dada_config> file, as old C<.dada_config> files will not work with v6 of Dada Mail. 

=head1 6.0.0 Release Candiate 2

=head2 Summary 6.0.0 Release Candidate 2

The changes below summarize the differences between RC1 and RC2 of the v6.0.0 Release

=over

=item * Membership >> Invite/Subscribe/Add was not functional, for anything except for the Subscribers sublist

This was a problem of a missing class in the, B<Add Checked Addresses to [sublist]> button. 

=item * Mass Mailing Started/Finished log messages were truncated

These log messages were missing some of the information that should have been present. 

=item * "Mass Mailing Finished" Message had the incorrect "finishing time" and, "Duration Time"

=item * Plugin URLs and Installer URL better guessed

The installer and plugin URLs attempt to guess their own URL, so you do not need to configure these things, yourself. 

Unfortunetly, it does not always get them right, depending on your hosting environment. Code has been added to make this guess better. 

=item * Screen Cache plugin's HTML has now been templated out

=item * Beatitude: Some options could not be saved, due to sloppy HTML

=item * CKEditor and the, "{C}" string: 

CKeditor seems to place the, "{C}" string in the source of HTML messages, when there'a a comment tag in an, "href" tag attribute (like, for example, in a link). Since Dada Mail's template tags are also valid HTML comments, they are found in, "href" attributes often. 

This string is never I<removed> by CKeditor, and thus, will break the link. It seems that this character is some sort of placeholder for comment tags, but seems not to be handled correctly by CKeditor. 

This string is now looked for, and removed, before messages are sent. 

=item * "Automatically set batching speeds based on your Amazon SES limits" was not functioning correctly 

=item * The Default CAPTCHA type was not working correctly, always returning an error

=item * Better support for server environments that don't support data sent via Path Infos

There's a trick in Dada Mail, where you can set the Program's URL to have a, "?" at the end of the URL, like this: 

	$PROGRAM_URL = 'http://example.com/cgi-bin/dada/mail.cgi?'; 

Which will then turn any Path Info, into a query string

Dada Mail will now correctly look for this, and use any information that I<looks> like a Path Info, passed as a query string as Path Info information and also correctly read double-question mark query strings correctly as well. 

It's still a hack-y workaround, but hopefully, could help someone get their work done. Is this a problem with "Zeus" webservers?

=item * Installer: now correctly removes the old screen cache, during an install/upgrade

=item * Installer: now correctly set the, $PROGRAM_ERROR_LOG variable, even if the .dada_files location is set to, "auto"

=item * Bounce Handler: web-based interface to parse bounces broken

The web-based interface to check any awaiting messages and parse them would look as if you're testing messages, but the messages would actually be parsed, scored and logged, except the messages would not be removed. This has been fixed.
