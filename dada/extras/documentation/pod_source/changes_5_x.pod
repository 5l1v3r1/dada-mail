=head1 5.0.3

=head2 Summary 5.0.3

This release contains primarily  bugfixes found in the v5.0.2 release of Dada Mail.
Many of the issues fixed deal with Discussion Mailing Lists 

If upgrading from v5.0.0 - v5.0.2, you will not need to create a new config file.

=head2 Changes 5.0.3

=head3 Small List, Admin Template Changes

The, following meta tag was added to the List and Admin templates: 

	<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
	
This is to help Internet Explorer for Windows use the latest HTML/css fancy features. 

=head3 Tracker: Subscriber Count Checks

It's been found that if you do not have, B<Enable Subscriber Count Logging> checked in the Tracker plugin, no 
logs will be reported for your mass mailings. Because of this, this feature has been B<removed>, but will be 
constantly enabled - so, one less thing to worry about. 

There's also been an issue revealed that if a mass mailing is created, but for whatever reason, fails 
to send out automatically, this type of tracking is never done, thus again, breaking the Tracker reports for 
your mass mailing. The reason for a mass mailing being created, but not sent right away remains a mystery and
does not happen every time a mass mailing is created, only a minority of the time, for some installations. 

A check has been put in place to look for this type of tracking information and, if not found, the "Number of Subscribers" 
tracking information will be put into the Tracker logs, without any further manual intervention. 

=head2 Bugfixes 5.0.3

=head3 Can't call method "agent" on an undefined value " when fetching a webpage

https://github.com/justingit/dada-mail/issues/280

This error will happen to some, when they try using the B<Send a Webpage> screen or use a 
URL for a list template. This error cropped up when attempting to fix issue #267 
(L<https://github.com/justingit/dada-mail/issues/267>) 

=head3 Tracker: Disabling, "Enable Subscriber Count Logging" basically breaks Tracker reports

https://github.com/justingit/dada-mail/issues/281

The problem here is that if you disable counting the number of subscribers you have, when you do a 
mass mailing, you basically disable tracking that message, since the tracker is looking for the 
entry about the #subs you have, when creating its report table. Because of this, this type of tracking 
will always be enabled.

=head3 Discussion Lists may send List Invites without template tags parsed

https://github.com/justingit/dada-mail/issues/282

This problem happens with discussion lists (and shouldn't affect any other type of mailing list) 
- you'll see that your invitations go to your invitees, without the template tags parsed. 

=head3 "Welcome", "Farewell" mass email message not templated out for discussion lists

https://github.com/justingit/dada-mail/issues/283

Similar to issue#282, these messages are sent out, without being templated out. 

=head3 Can't access 'redirect' field in object of class DADA::App::Subscriptions at mail.cgi line 6733

https://github.com/justingit/dada-mail/issues/288

=head1 5.0.0

=head2 Summary 5.0.0

=head1 Bounce Handler

This release of Dada Mail features the continuing work on the Bounce Handler. This round of enhancements
centers around a new sublist called, "Bouncing Addresses" (or, "bounced_list", internally). 
You may now direct the Bounce Handler to move addresses that have reached the Bounce Score Threshold  
to this list, instead of outright removing them from your Subscribers. 

From there, you may view the bounced history of each bouncing  address and either permanently remove the address from your mailing list, or reinstate the address as a subscriber

=head1 New View Screen

This release of Dada Mail also features a clean-up of the, "View" screen in Dada Mail. 
These changes are to help a list owner feel more in control over their mailing list, by making the various mailing lists 
more malleable to work with. 

Members of all sublists can be easily browsed through using enhancement pagination links - first, last, previous, next pages (etc), as well as more organized searching,
that features the same refined user interface. The data can now be sorted alphabetically, 
ascending or descending by email address or by any of the profile fields.

=head1 New Address Membership Screen

Individual subscribers can now be more easily administrated. From each subscriber's membership screen, you can now see all the 
sublists an individual address is a member of and move the address to and from various sublists. A running history of the addresses membership is
also available. 

Recent subscription/unsubscription activity is also now easily viewed in a new admin screen titled, B<Recent Activity> which 
currently shows the last 100 seperate events that have happened in your mailing list.

=head2 Sending a Copy to the List Owner

You may now enable or disable sending a copy of Mass Mailings to the List Owner.
