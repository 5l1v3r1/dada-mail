=head1 Dada Mail Changelog for version 5.x.x

=head1 5.1.0

=head2 Summary 5.1.0 

This release of Dada Mail contains a well of new features, plugins and bug fixes. 

If upgrading from any previous version of Dada Mail, we highly suggest B<Creating a new .dada_config file>, when using the included Dada Mail installer, as many items in the starter C<.dada_config> file has now changed. 

=head2 Features 5.1.0

=head3 Update Subscriber Email Address

You now have the ability to update a subscriber's email address, through the List Control Panel. 

Individual subscribers have had the ability to update their email address, using Dada Mail's B<Profiles>, but the List Owner has never had the ability to do this on-behalf of their subscribers. This new feature fixes this hole in Dada Mail's functionality. 

You can now updat an email address on your current mailing list, or 
on every mailing list.  

Profile information is also updated with the new email address, or copied over, if a Profile for the updated email address already exists. A lot of work has been done to make sure you do not lose Profile information. 

=head3 New Plugin: Change List Shortname

Each Dada Mail mailing list has a, B<List Shortname> - the internal name used by Dada Mail to differentiate mailing lists from one another. The list shortname is also used for values in subscription forms and subscripiton/unsubscription/confirmation links. Sometimes it's desired to change this list shortname. 

This plugin now gives you that ability. 

See the docs on the plugin for more information: 

L<http://dadamailproject.com/d/change_list_shortname.cgi.html>

=head3 New Plugin: Password Protected Directories

Dada Mail's mailing lists, along with each addresses Profile holds valuable information that can be repurposed for various tasks. 

This plugin allows you to password protect a directory, only allowing your mailing list subscribers access, using their subscription to your mailing list and their Dada Mail Profile password as credentials. 

See the docs on the plugin for more information: 

L<http://dadamailproject.com/d/password_protect_directories.cgi.html>

=head3 New Plugin: Default Mass Mailing Messages

Having default copy available, in the PlainText and/or HTML Versions of your mailing list messages, ready to be used as a starter for your next mailing list message would be convenient. 

This plugin allows you to set that default copy for your Mailing List Messages, that will appear in your B<Send a Message>, 
B<Send a Webpage> screens, as well as in B<Beatitude>.

See the docs on the plugin for more information: 

L<http://dadamailproject.com/d/default_mass_mailing_messages.cgi>

=head3 Send a Message Screen: Show/Hide PlainText/HTML Versions

You may now set which Mailing List Message Version textboxes are visible by default, in the, B<Your List Control Panel E<gt>E<gt> Options> screen. 

For example, this becomes useful if you send primarily HTML messages, you have one of the support WYSIWYG editors installed and are using the new B<Mass Mailing Messages> plugin to set default copy to edit within the WYSIWYG editor. 

=head3 Amazon SES: Auto-Adjusting Batch Settings

Amazon SES is a powerful third-part mailing service that allows you to have a mailing list on a relatively cheap hosting account, without having to deal with or worry about the sometimes lacking hourly email quotas allowed. 

The problem with Amazon SES is that the mailing sending quotas may start off small, but then grow depending on your usage of the service. Keeping current on this changing quota is an annoyance, especially when the quota is temporarily small and sending must be done slowly. 

Now built into Dada Mail is the ability to automatically set the optimal batch settings needed for Amazon SES sending. You may now simply let Dada Mail figure out what is the most optimal batch setting for your mailing list. This feature works with either the SES API or using the SES SMTP interface. 

=head3 Profiles

=head4 Profile Passwords  in the List Control Panel

List Owners now how the option to reset a user's Profile Password in the List Control Panel, under: B<Membership E<gt>E<gt> View> (then, select a member of your mailing list)

=head4 Email Notifications of Changed Profile Email Addresses

You now how the option to receive a notification of any changes made by a user of their Profile email address. 

For more information about this feature, see: 

L<http://dadamailproject.com/d/features-profiles.pod.html#send_notification_to_profile_email> 

=head4 Multiple Admin Profile Email Addresses Supported

You may now set more than one email addresses used for administration email notification, profile activation, etc, email messages. 

For more information about this feature, see: 

L<http://dadamailproject.com/d/features-profiles.pod.html#profile_email> 

=head4 Customize Email Validation Steps for Profile Email Address Changes

For more information about this feature, see: 

L<http://dadamailproject.com/d/features-profiles.pod.html#subscription_check_skip>

=head3 List Invitations: Already Been Invited Check

List Invitations are a powerful tool in Dada Mail, as they allow you to invite a new member to join your mailing list, and thus allowing the potential member themselves to make a decision on whether they would like to join, or not. 

It becomes a hassle, though, the more you use this feature, as it's difficult to keep track of who you've already invited. Constantly asking someone to join your mailing list is not the type of behaviour we suggest. 

Before you send a List Invitation, you may now have checks done to see if the addresses you want to invite haven't already been invited in the past, saving you from pestering potential members.

=head1 5.0.3

=head2 Summary 5.0.3

This release contains primarily bugfixes found in the v5.0.2 release of Dada Mail.
Many of the issues fixed deal with Discussion Mailing Lists 

If upgrading from v5.0.0 - v5.0.2, you will not need to create a new config file.

=head2 Changes 5.0.3

=head3 Small List, Admin Template Changes

The, following meta tag was added to the List and Admin templates: 

	<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
	
This is to help Internet Explorer for Windows use the latest HTML/css fancy features. 

=head3 Tracker: Subscriber Count Checks

It's been found that if you do not have, B<Enable Subscriber Count Logging> checked in the Tracker plugin, no 
logs will be reported for your mass mailings. Because of this, this feature has been B<removed>, but will be 
constantly enabled - so, one less thing to worry about. 

There's also been an issue revealed that if a mass mailing is created, but for whatever reason, fails 
to send out automatically, this type of tracking is never done, thus again, breaking the Tracker reports for 
your mass mailing. The reason for a mass mailing being created, but not sent right away remains a mystery and
does not happen every time a mass mailing is created, only a minority of the time, for some installations. 

A check has been put in place to look for this type of tracking information and, if not found, the "Number of Subscribers" 
tracking information will be put into the Tracker logs, without any further manual intervention. 

=head2 Bugfixes 5.0.3

=head3 Can't call method "agent" on an undefined value " when fetching a webpage

https://github.com/justingit/dada-mail/issues/280

This error will happen to some, when they try using the B<Send a Webpage> screen or use a 
URL for a list template. This error cropped up when attempting to fix issue #267 
(L<https://github.com/justingit/dada-mail/issues/267>) 

=head3 Tracker: Disabling, "Enable Subscriber Count Logging" basically breaks Tracker reports

https://github.com/justingit/dada-mail/issues/281

The problem here is that if you disable counting the number of subscribers you have, when you do a 
mass mailing, you basically disable tracking that message, since the tracker is looking for the 
entry about the #subs you have, when creating its report table. Because of this, this type of tracking 
will always be enabled.

=head3 Discussion Lists may send List Invites without template tags parsed

https://github.com/justingit/dada-mail/issues/282

This problem happens with discussion lists (and shouldn't affect any other type of mailing list) 
- you'll see that your invitations go to your invitees, without the template tags parsed. 

=head3 "Welcome", "Farewell" mass email message not templated out for discussion lists

https://github.com/justingit/dada-mail/issues/283

Similar to issue#282, these messages are sent out, without being templated out.

=head2 Summary 5.0.0

=head1 Bounce Handler

This release of Dada Mail features the continuing work on the Bounce Handler. This round of enhancements
centers around a new sublist called, "Bouncing Addresses" (or, "bounced_list", internally). 
You may now direct the Bounce Handler to move addresses that have reached the Bounce Score Threshold  
to this list, instead of outright removing them from your Subscribers. 

From there, you may view the bounced history of each bouncing  address and either permanently remove the address from your mailing list, or reinstate the address as a subscriber

=head1 New View Screen

This release of Dada Mail also features a clean-up of the, "View" screen in Dada Mail. 
These changes are to help a list owner feel more in control over their mailing list, by making the various mailing lists 
more malleable to work with. 

Members of all sublists can be easily browsed through using enhancement pagination links - first, last, previous, next pages (etc), as well as more organized searching,
that features the same refined user interface. The data can now be sorted alphabetically, 
ascending or descending by email address or by any of the profile fields.

=head1 New Address Membership Screen

Individual subscribers can now be more easily administrated. From each subscriber's membership screen, you can now see all the 
sublists an individual address is a member of and move the address to and from various sublists. A running history of the addresses membership is
also available. 

Recent subscription/unsubscription activity is also now easily viewed in a new admin screen titled, B<Recent Activity> which 
currently shows the last 100 seperate events that have happened in your mailing list.

=head1 Mass Mailing Preferences

=head2 Sending a Copy to the List Owner

You may now enable or disable sending a copy of Mass Mailings to the List Owner.
